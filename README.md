# smugcli
Command line tool for SmugMug, useful for automatically synchronizing a local folder hierarchy with a SmugMug account.

Implemented using the V2 API. Tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

# Installation

* `git clone` the repository from github.
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Sample usage

To use this command line tool, you will need to request your own API key by visiting https://api.smugmug.com/api/developer/apply. Using your key and secret, loging to smugcli using the following command:
```
$ ./smugcli.py login --key=<key> --secret=<secret>
```

This is a one time operation. From this point on, smugcli will be able to access your SmugMug account. To logout, run the command: `$ ./smugcli.py logout`

You can list the content of your SmugMug account by doing:
```
$ ./smugcli.py ls
 Photography
 Portfolio
 Other

$ ./smugcli.py ls Photography
 2014
 2015
 2016


$ ./smugcli.py ls Photography/2015
 Photoshoot with Dave
```
Note that smugcli can also be used to access other public SmugMug account by using the `--user` argument:
```
$ ./smugcli.py ls -u <username>
```

Folders can be created by using the `mkdir` command:
```
$ ./smugcli.py mkdir Photography/2017
```

Similarily, albums can be created by doing:
```
$ ./smugcli.py mkalbum 'Photography/2017/My new album'
```

To upload photos to an album, run:
```
$ ./smugcli.py upload local/folder/*.jpg 'Photography/2017/My new album'
```

Finally, the nicest feature of all, you can synchronize a whole local folder hierarchy to your SmugMug account using the `sync` command:
```
$ ./smugcli.py sync local/folder remote/folder
Creating Folder "remote/folder/2015".
Creating Album "remote/folder/2015/2015-08-03, Mary's Wedding".
Uploading "local/folder/2015/2015-08-03, Mary's Wedding/DSC_0001.JPG"
Uploading "local/folder/2015/2015-08-03, Mary's Wedding/DSC_0002.JPG"
Uploading "local/folder/2015/2015-08-03, Mary's Wedding/DSC_0003.JPG"
...
Creating Album "remote/folder/2015/2015-09-10, Andy's Photoshoot"
Uploading "local/folder/2015/2015-09-10, Andy's Photoshoot/DSC_0043.JPG"
Uploading "local/folder/2015/2015-09-10, Andy's Photoshoot/DSC_0052.JPG"
...
```

The sync command can be re-executed to update the remote Albums in the event that the local files might have been updated. Only the files that changed will be re-uploaded.

Multiple sources can be synced in the same operation, the last argument being the destination folder and the others being the sources:
```
$ ./smugcli.py sync 2016 2017 2018 remote/folder
Syncing:
  2016
  2017
  2018
to SmugMug folder "remote/folder"',
...

$ ./smugcli.py sync 201* remote/folder
...
```

Source files are synced to the destination SmugMug album and source folders are recursively synced to the destination SmugMug folder. For source folders with a trailing path delimitor ('/' or '\\' depending on OS), only the content of the folder is synced, skipping the folder itself (equivalent of doing `folder/*`). This means that `smugcli.py sync src/album dst` is equivalent to `smugcli.py sync src/album/ dst/album`. If no sources or destinations are specified, smugcli defaults to syncing the current folder to the SmugMug user's root.

The sync command uses multiple threads to speed-up the file scanning and upload.
You may want to tune the number of threads used by SmugCLI depending on your
machine's performance. For instance:
```
$ ./smugcli.py sync local/folder remote/folder --folder_threads=4 --file_threads=8 --upload_threads=2
```

`folder_threads` control the number of album folders that are processed in
parallel.  `file_threads` specifies the number fo files that are read from disk
and compared with the server side version in parallel. `upload_threads` controls
the number of parallel upload operations allowed when sending content to
SmugMug. Keep in mind that too many or too few threads can be harmful to
performance. Also keep in mind that increasing file_threads or upload_threads
means that more files will be loaded in memory at the same time. If you have
many large video files, loading too many in parallel could hog your system's
resources.

When you are happy with the performance using certain thread counts, you may
save these preferences so that they'd be used as defaults next time:
```
$ ./smugcli.py sync --set_defaults --folder_threads=4 --file_threads=8 --upload_threads=2
```

To exclude paths from the sync operation, run the command:
```
$ ./smugcli.py ignore local/folder/export-tmp
```

To undo this operation, you can run:
```
$ ./smugcli.py include local/folder/export-tmp
```

# Running the tests
PLEASE READ, RUN UNIT TESTS AT YOUR OWN RISKS: smugcli's unit-tests use the logged-in user account to do run actual commands on SmugMug. All operations *should* be performed in a `__smugcli_unit_tests__` subfolder in the SmugMug account's root. This folder *should* be deleted automatically when/if the test completes. If in doubt, do `smugcli.py logout && smugcli.py login` and use a test account.

Run all unit tests by running:
```
$ ./run_tests.py
```

Individual tests can be ran by doing:
```
$ ./run_tests.py module[.class_name[.test_name]]
```
for instance:
```
$ ./run_tests.py end_to_end_test  # Runs all tests in module end_to_end_test.
$ ./run_tests.py end_to_end_test.EndToEndTest  # Runs all tests in class EndToEndTest.
$ ./run_tests.py end_to_end_test.EndToEndTest.test_mkdir  # Runs a single test.
```

SmugMug is slow, so to speed up iterations while changing code, all HTTP requests are cached on disk and replayed on subsequent runs. The first test run will take a while, but the second one should take about a second. When updating tests however, the cached HTTP request may no longer match the new test code. Reset the cache by using `--reset_cache`:
```
$ ./run_tests.py end_to_end_test.EndToEndTest.test_mkdir --reset_cache
```
